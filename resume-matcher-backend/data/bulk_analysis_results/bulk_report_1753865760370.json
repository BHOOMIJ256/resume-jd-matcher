    "analysis": "Here's an analysis of Orvin's resume against the Python Developer (Web Scraping focus) job description:\n\nKey Strengths:\n*   **Strong Python Development Background:** Orvin possesses 3.8+ years of experience as a Python Backend Developer, significantly exceeding the 2+ years requirement. His expertise in Django, FastAPI, and DRF demonstrates robust Python proficiency.\n*   **API Development & Integration Experience:** He has extensive experience developing and maintaining RESTful APIs, building secure API layers, and leveraging the `Requests` library for interacting with internal databases via endpoints. This aligns well with the need to \"Leverage APIs when web scraping is not feasible, managing authentication and request optimization.\"\n*   **Database Proficiency:** Orvin has strong experience with both SQL (PostgreSQL, including schema design, indexing, and performance optimization) and NoSQL (MongoDB) databases, which are essential for storing scraped data.\n*   **Data Manipulation with Pandas:** The resume clearly highlights multiple instances of using Pandas for data cleaning, manipulation, and support scripts, directly addressing a key technical requirement.\n*   **CI/CD & DevOps Understanding:** Experience with Jenkins, Git, and deploying applications on AWS EC2/RDS indicates a good understanding of CI/CD pipelines, which supports the maintainability of scraping solutions.\n*   **Soft Skills Alignment:** Orvin's listed soft skills (Communication, Problem-Solving, Critical Thinking, Adaptability) and demonstrated collaborative experience (cross-functional teams, requirement gathering) align perfectly with the non-technical skills required.\n*   **Problem-Solving & Efficiency:** Quantifiable achievements like improving query performance by 40% and reducing manual workload by 60% (saving 15 hours weekly) showcase strong analytical and problem-solving abilities.\n*   **Git Version Control:** Explicitly listed and used in his professional experience.\n\nMissing Skills:\n*   **Web Scraping Experience:** The most significant gap is the lack of explicit experience in web scraping, which is a core focus of this role (\"at least 1 year focused on web scraping\").\n*   **Specific Web Scraping Libraries:** There is no mention of proficiency with BeautifulSoup, Scrapy, or Selenium, which are explicitly listed as required technical skills.\n*   **Advanced Scraping Techniques:** Experience with handling dynamic websites, CAPTCHA-solving, and implementing IP rotation techniques is not demonstrated.\n*   **Regular Expressions (Regex):** Not explicitly mentioned for data parsing, though often implicitly used by developers.\n*   **NumPy:** While Pandas is heavily featured, NumPy is a required data manipulation library that is not explicitly mentioned.\n*   **Containerization Tools (Docker):** Listed as a bonus skill, but not present on the resume.\n*   **Distributed Scraping & Task Queues (Celery, RabbitMQ):** Listed as bonus skills, but not present on the resume.\n*   **Data Visualization Tools:** Listed as a bonus skill, but not present on the resume.",
