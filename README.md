## How Matching Works

1. **Text Extraction**: Resume and JD are parsed to extract raw text using `pdf-parse`, `docx`, or `mammoth`.
2. **Embedding & Similarity** *(optional)*: You can add embedding-based similarity using models like `Sentence-BERT` or Gemini.
3. **LLM-Powered Analysis**: Gemini takes in the resume and JD text and generates:
   - Match Score
   - Verdict (e.g., Strong/Moderate/Weak Match)
   - Key Strengths
   - Missing Skills
   - Recommendations for improvement
4. **Output Formatting**: Results are added to Excel with all the metadata.
